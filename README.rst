Setup working environment on ubuntu
-----------------------------------

It's recommended to install Ubuntu 12.04 as it's currently the mass development environment of other our interested open source projects.

Run the following command to download the bash script to setup working environment:
::
    cd ~/Downloads
    wget https://raw.github.com/teracy-official/dev/master/scripts/setup_working_env.sh
    chmod +x setup_working_env.sh
    ./setup_working_env.sh
